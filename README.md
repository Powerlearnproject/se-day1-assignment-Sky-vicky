Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
this systematically applies software principle, methods and tools to develop and maintain highquality software 

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
is a disciplined approach to the product design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software systems.
Importance: for healthcare, communication, Quality assuarance, Efficiency and cost management.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. the development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C)
2. the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
3. the advent of structured programming in the 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  - Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface to see if it can meet user needs 
  - Implementation: coding of programming and building the software according to the design specifications
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users to work with it and make work easier
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing enhancements to the software and updating

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall while agile is iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer - Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager - Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- Integrated Development Environment - Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g., Visual Studio.
- Version Control System - Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g., Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges: - Changing Requirements
            - Tight Deadlines
            - Technical Debt
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: - effective communication
                                      - agile methodologies
                                      - prioritization of tasks
                                      - timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
importance - making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
example. If you ask, 'Tell me about cats,' the AI might give a general answer. 
But if you ask, 'Tell me about the history of domestic cats,' you'll get a more focused response.
